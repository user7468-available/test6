    you can also use the <br> tag to create a line break(start a new line bro the copilot literally complicate things) in the text.
    <br> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag
    <br> tag is used to insert a single line break.(wtf the copilot is giving me a lot of information that I don't need)
    oh btw you can also use the <hr> tag to create a horizontal line in the text
      
    <hr> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag
    <hr> tag is used to insert a horizontal line in the text(copilot said it btw)
    <hr> tag is used to separate content in the text
    i never try hr tag before so maybe i'll try it out later
    wow the copilot is so smart, it can even tell me what hr tag is used for(i'm not sure if i should be impressed or scared its complimenting itselg btw lol)
      
    ok i think i should stop talking to the copilot and start writing the code(wtf copilot is saying all of this)
    no shit im impress
    anyway about the hr it literally creates a mother fucking line(horizontol)
